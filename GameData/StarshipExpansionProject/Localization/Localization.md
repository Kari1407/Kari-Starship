## Translation Guide

If you want to help us translate this mod follow this quick guide to get started.

### How to translate
To create a translation for your language, make a copy of the file *en_us.cfg* and name
them accordingly to your language:

* Chinese (zh-cn)
* Deutsch (de-de)
* French (fr-fr)
* Italian (it-it)
* Japanese (ja)
* ~~Portuguese (pt-br)~~ 
* Russian (ru)
* Spanish (es-es)

Any languages crossed out ~~like this~~ are already assigned to someone or finished.

### What not to translate

1. Tags in en-us should stay for other languages. Tags in the new language should be added after those.
2. Unique part names like Donnager, Nagata, Draper, Behemoth should stay the same, the rest of the title can be adjusted with minimal modification.


Please avoid using translators and/or AI, we will give preference for native/fluent speakers of the language being translated to. The goal is to make a decent adaptation, not to speedrun it.
